The dataset will first be introduced in terms of its origin, content, and features, followed by an investigation into the distribution of action frequency within the dataset. Finally, a description will be provided of the baseline model proposed by the dataset creators, along with an account of the evaluation results.

\section{Introduction}
The Animal Kingdom dataset was proposed in CVPR 2022, which contains 50 hours of video clips with up to 850 unique species and 140 fine-grained classes of actions for action recognition. In addition, the footage provided is shot in diverse environmental conditions (e.g., grassland, forests, rivers, oceans) \parencite{ng2022animal}.

\section{Action Classes Frequency Distribution}

    \caption[Action Classes Frequency Distribution]{This Chart shows the long-tail distribution of action class frequency. On the graph, the X-axis represents the action index, and the y-axis displays the action count. The action classes in green colour are frequent classes, while the action classes in blue and red colour are less frequent or rare classes.}
    \label{fig:classfreqdist}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:classfreqdist} illustrates the long-tail features of the dataset. It is obvious that the dataset is highly imbalanced. The frequent classes account for 80\% of the dataset, while the less frequent and rare classes only account for less than 20\% of the dataset.

\section{Baseline Model}
The dataset paper also proposed its own model, Collaborative Action Recognition (CARe), for action recognition, which is used as the baseline model in this research. It can achieve 30.55 on overall mAP, 63.33 mAP for head classes, 38.62 for middle classes, and 25.09 for tail classes.
