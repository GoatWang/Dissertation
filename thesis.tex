% Abstract should be not more than 300 words, for either MSc or PhD.

This research discusses the solutions to two significant challenges for animal action recognition: the long-tail issue and the temporal redundancy problem. CLIP model combined with text prompt engineering is experimented with to solve the long-tail problem. The approach leverages class embeddings as learning targets instead of traditional one-hot encoding, significantly mitigating the unbalanced distribution of learning targets caused by the long-tail issue. Simultaneously, the AFRICAN method is introduced to handle the temporal redundancy issue. It utilizes a contrastive learning framework, encouraging the model to capture subtle and fine-grained variations between video frames. By integrating CLIP, good at understanding the semantic meaning of images, into AFRICAN, excellent at observing fine-grained displacements across frames, the AFRICAN model for action recognition is able to outperform the baseline model 24.53\% mAP for all classes, 10.83\% for the head classes, 26.88\% for the middle classes, and 22.41\% for the tail classes.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Comprehensive investigation into the challenges associated with the long-tail and temporal redundancy issues in action recognition tasks.
    \item Exploration of the CLIP model with text prompt engineering as a solution for the long-tail issue, converting the traditional one-hot encoding learning target to class embedding, thus enhancing the model's performance, especially for middle and tail classes.
    \item Introduction of AFRICAN, a novel method leveraging the contrastive learning framework, to focus on the subtle and fine-grained differences between video frames, addressing the temporal redundancy issue effectively.
    \item Extensive experimentation, as detailed from page 31 onwards, demonstrating the efficacy of the CLIP model with text prompt engineering and AFRICAN in addressing their respective challenges.
    \item investigation and discussion on the comparative performance of ImageCLIP versus VideoCLIP and the reasons for MSQNet's performance over AFRICAN.
