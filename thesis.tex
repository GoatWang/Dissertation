% Abstract should be not more than 300 words, for either MSc or PhD.

This research discusses the solutions to two significant challenges for animal action recognition: the long-tail issue and the temporal redundancy problem. The CLIP model, paired with text prompt engineering, is investigated as a potential solution for the long-tail problem. Simultaneously, the AFRICAN approach is introduced to handle the temporal redundancy problem. By integrating CLIP into AFRICAN, this augmented model outperforms the baseline model with 24.53\% overall mAP for all classes.

The primary contributions of this research are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Comprehensive investigation into the challenges associated with the long-tail and temporal redundancy issues in action recognition tasks.
    \item Exploration of the CLIP model combined with text prompt engineering as a solution for the long-tail issue. This approach converts the traditional one-hot encoding learning target to class embedding, enhancing the model's performance, especially for middle and tail classes.
    \item Introduction of AFRICAN, a novel method leveraging the contrastive learning framework, to focus on the subtle and fine-grained differences between video frames, addressing the temporal redundancy issue effectively.
    \item Extensive experimentation, as detailed from page 27 onwards, demonstrating the efficacy of the CLIP model with text prompt engineering and AFRICAN in addressing their respective challenges.
    \item A comparative discussion on the performance of ImageCLIP versus VideoCLIP, coupled with insights into why the state-of-the-art model, MSQNet, excels over AFRICAN.
\end{itemize}
